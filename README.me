This Daily Planner required navigating dayjs, and jquery. 
I used a timeInterval function in conjuction with dayjs
tocapture the current time in the header. I used sibling
and parent attributes to capture user inputs in localStorage,
and jquery's add and remove functions in the conditional logic
to add and remove CSS class attributes.
